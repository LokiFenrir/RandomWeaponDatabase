# RandomWeaponDatabase
This is a cool database system that I had created, this can be used to place a random weapon in a weapons list and place it on a players hand. So you can add 100 weapons and it will spawn only 2 at random

Place a weapon sprite or gameobject in the script, this will allow you to be able to access said gameobject in the resources folder and you can then call it in game. 
Please note that this is fully from a script base and is not applicable in the hierarchy in unity
